                                Our way of working allows us to do software
                                outsourcing better than traditional players in
                                the market. Users of outsourcing services are
                                generally complaining about 2 things: quality
                                and communication. Tunga works with highly
                                motivated and loyal developers who are eager to
                                learn and understand that meeting client
                                expectations in terms of quality and
                                communication is key. Our platform is set-up to
                                help the developers be successful by matching
                                only verified skills, by using best practice
                                templates in project planning and specifying
                                requirements, and by requiring them to report
                                daily on progress and quality so that any hiccup
                                can be dealt with early on. Building experience
                                and client relations like this, our developers
                                eventually can take charge of their own careers
                                and ultimately their lives. And that’s exactly
                                what we aim for..

                                The first thing that we do is screening
                                the CV, references, recent projects of
                                the applicant. If the experience of the
                                developer meets our standard we invite
                                them to a remote interview with one of
                                our senior developers or project
                                coordinators. During this interview, we
                                assess their English proficiency level
                                and communication skills.

                                When a developer has successfully passed
                                the first stage of our program we assess
                                our developers on several "soft skills".
                                Such as communication skills, management
                                of expectations, work ethics, stress
                                management and time management. At
                                Tunga, we believe that soft skills are
                                as much or more important than software
                                development skills.

                                their coding skills. We do this in
                                several ways: reviewing recent projects,
                                online coding tests, and in depth Skype
                                interviews. Only the brightest
                                developers are selected to go to the
                                next stage of our program.
